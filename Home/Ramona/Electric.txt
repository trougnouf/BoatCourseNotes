2* solar panels
12v
110v

charge batteries w/ 110v if < 50%
12v: fridge, lights, stove
120v: computer
?: clim, stove, water boiler

charge batteries with solar, unless very low then std

**smart ac charger stops at given voltage**

combine AC and batteries/inverter

* charge batteries with panels (and land when batteries are low)
	a. use an inverter from batteries to 220V at all times (simplest? wasteful)
	b. use an inverter from batteries to 220V, switch between BAT and land depending on battery level
* charge batteries with panels (for 12V subsystem), use an inverter on solar panels and supplement land directly (can solar panel feed both? can land be supplemented w/solar and have solar take priority?) â†’ 220V does not use batteries

How to combine solar and grid, 


Hello,
I recently purchased a houseboat in Utrecht, https://www.doevemakelaar.nl/en/schip/935/beurtvaarder-15-65 , and I would like to have it equipped with as much solar energy generation as it can fit. It has two small ones currently but I believe there is room for more.
I would also like to have an electrical system where solar energy can feed batteries (to be upgraded), which then feed the 12V system (lights and fridge) and the 220V appliance.
The boat will be connected to land almost all the time. It doesn't matter if 220V is available when I'm not onshore as long as I have the 12V. I will draw about 600W from 220V from my computer at all times, and the fridge and light use a small amount of 12V energy.
I would like to have the work done before I move the boat to Belgium at the end of August. Are you able to come where the boat is or I need to move the boat to you? It is difficult for me to move the boat because I don't yet have a license, but I can hire someone if necessary.
Thank you for your time.
Best,
Benoit

===== combine solar and grid without sending excess energy back to grid =====
need to keep some 12v charged (motor always, rest a bit?)
220V w/inverter: use when batteries are up (at least 50percent?)
hybrid

===== Solar+grid w/o inverter from batteries =====

need:
2 large solar panels
12v battery for motor
12v for some appliances (lights, fridge)
	either separate batteries or DC-DC conversion from the storage battery bank used by AC system
3 to 5 kW AC
	can use the grid. should not go back to the grid

charging from generator, solar, grid



===== 24V main bank, 12V motor, 220V AC/inverter =====

options at 12V:
options at 24V:
	EasySolar 3000VA
options at 48V:
	EasySolar 5000VA
	EasySolar II 3000VA
too expensive (3000EUR), see MultiPlus below

12V battery to generator, engine stuff, DC-DC 48-12
48V battery bank to 48-12 DC-DC, (MPPT_solar_charger, inverter+land_charger):easysolar
solar_panels to MPPT_solar_charger
inverter to 220V appliances
48-12 DC-DC to 12V appliances

maybe use inverter with passthrough AC when batteries are low,
then no need to recharge the batteries with AC
